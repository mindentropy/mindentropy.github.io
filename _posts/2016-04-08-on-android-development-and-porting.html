<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I have decided to work on parallel to learn to understand the android system and porting to a new SoC. My baremetal adventures will continue as is but this a slight distraction/relaxation from the intense work of the baremetal OS.<br /><br />I will post articles and examples on what I have learnt in android along with some mini projects to demonstrate the concepts. I will referring to "Embedded Android" by Karim Yaghmour to learn my concepts. The development board which I will be using is a Wandboard dual with Bluetooth and WiFi. It has a NXP/Freescale i.MX6 dual core processor in it. </div>
