<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I have been asked many times and for that manner many of you might have faced this before these questions "why do you do things from scratch." "Why bother when it is already done." "You should do things which are more abstract if the base is already done."<br /><br />The problem with this is if a person has the qualities of questioning, reasoning and a childlike curiosity it becomes extremely hard to explain why they do it. For me it is the sense of satisfaction and happiness that I get when I understand what is it that made it work or the core principles behind it. There is also the feeling of guilt that I am not sure what I am standing on.<br /><br />You get a sense of power knowing the finer details and the core principles behind it. You will be able to appreciate the cleverness of how and why it was done. You get more ideas of how it could be done. One of the pleasures that I have is re-deriving basic mathematics principles, things which I had skipped knowing that it holds true. You feel like you are in that mathematician's shoes in an adventure to prove that proof or derive that equation.<br /><br />I will end this with a beautiful quote of my favorite physicist Dr.Richard Feynman which was scribbled on his <a href="http://archives.caltech.edu/pictures/1.10-29.jpg">blackboard</a> at Caltech.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="text-align: center;"><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i><b>What I cannot create, I do not understand.</b></i><br /><i><b>Know how to solve every problem that has been solved.</b></i></blockquote></div><br /><br /></div>
