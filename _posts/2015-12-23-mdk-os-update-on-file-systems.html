<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Currently I will be working in parallel on implementing the FAT32 file system. Initially work will be done to just read the file system. Write and Modify will come later.<br /><br />Now what is the need for implementing it from scratch?<br />It is to learn how FAT32 is implemented. I will writing posts on different aspects of the file system and the design decisions taken. This hopefully will act like a reference for people implementing their own or help them debug their system.<br /><br />The development will be done outside the MDK OS tree. This is mainly for the ease of development and debugging. Later on it will be integrated with the MDK OS.</div>
