<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Long time since my last post.&nbsp; I had initially started off with the ethernet driver development but kept it pending due the lack of understanding of the timing diagrams. In its place I have started off with USB development. I will have a detailed write up once I have something going.</div>
