<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: left;"><b>Hello World!</b></div><br />Welcome to the "The Soul of a Machine". This is inspired by the book "The Soul of a New Machine" by Tracy Kidder. As in the book the "Soul" is my soul which lives on in the silicon as code. The blog documents this soul and the machines in which they live.</div>
